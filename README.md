# hello-world

Hello! I am David Rupell. I picked Computer Science as my major simply because I enjoyed working with computers. I initially wanted to go into Mathematics or Physics, but switched right before I enrolled at Camden County College, and I have been happy with my decision since.
In Software Engineering I am hoping to learn more about version control software and the software development process as a whole. I am most excited to learn how to coordinate with a bigger group on a longer term project for the semester as I feel it will be a valuble experience that will follow me into my career.
